# Image Enlargement with Interpolation

This repository contains a Python implementation for image enlargement, using different interpolation techniques. The code supports zero-order, first-order, and arbitrary-order interpolation methods to upscale images, providing a balance between quality and computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Zero-Order Interpolation (Nearest Neighbor)**: A straightforward method that enlarges images by replicating the nearest pixel value.
- **First-Order Interpolation (Bilinear)**: Utilizes linear interpolation between adjacent pixels to achieve smoother transitions and better image quality.
- **Arbitrary-Order Interpolation**: Allows the use of higher-order interpolation methods, providing more flexibility and potentially higher quality enlargements.

## Customization
- **Scaling Factors**: Define the desired scale for enlargement, either uniformly or independently along each axis.
- **Interpolation Order**: Choose the desired interpolation method based on the trade-off between speed and quality.
- **Examples**: Includes sample images and scripts to demonstrate the effects of different interpolation orders on image enlargement.
